It posits that China reconciles its status dilemma as it weighs decisions to intervene, seeking recognition from both its intervention peer groups of great powers and developing states. Understanding the impact and scope of conditions of status answers why China has taken certain positions regarding intervention and how these positions were justified. Foreign policy behavior that complies with status, and related social factors like self-image and identity, means that China can select policy options bearing material costs. <em>China and Intervention at the UN Security Council</em> draws on an extensive collection of data, including over two hundred interviews with UN officials and Chinese foreign policy elites, participant observation at UN Headquarters, and a dataset of Chinese-language analysis regarding foreign-imposed regime change and intervention. The book concludes with new perspectives on the malleability of China’s core interests, insights about the application of status for cooperation, and the implications of the status dilemma for rising powers.<span class="cube"></span></p>  </div><div class="field field-name-field-book-review field-type-text-long field-label-above">    <div class="field-label">Book Review: </div>                      <p><a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2020-02-11/china-and-intervention-un-security-council-reconciling-status" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Andrew Nathan, <em>Foreign Affairs</em> (April 27, 2018)</a></p>            </div>  </div>
