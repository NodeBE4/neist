It is not clear from the wording of the <em>Global Times</em> article whether police censured the NGO for failing to register a <a href="https://www.chinafile.com/ngo/faq/representative-office-faqs-registering-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">representative office</a> or for failing to file for a <a href="https://www.chinafile.com/ngo/faq/temporary-activity-faqs-filing-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">temporary activity</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.njp.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nying-Jey Projects website</a> shows that the organization had provided education- and medical-related financial support to hundreds of students, nuns, and monks in Garze as recently as this month. The website also states that the organization will not be taking on new sponsorships in the area “due to the ongoing situation,” though it does not provide any further details.</p><p>The China NGO Project has not seen the original Ministry of Public Security report on which the <a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1223453.shtml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Global Times</em> article</a> is based. Nying-Jey Projects did not immediately respond to our requests for comment. We will provide updates as they become available.</p></div></div></div>  </div>
