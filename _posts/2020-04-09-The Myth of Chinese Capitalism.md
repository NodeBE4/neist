He focuses on two places: the village of Binghuacun in Guizhou province, one of China’s poorest regions that sends the highest proportion of its youth away; and Dongguan, China’s most infamous factory town located in Guangdong, home to both the largest number of migrant workers and the country’s biggest manufacturing base.</p><p>Within these two towns and the people that move between them, Roberts focuses on the story of the Mo family, former farmers-turned-migrant-workers who are struggling to make a living in a fast-changing country that relegates half of its people to second-class status via household registration, land tenure policies, and inequality in education and health care systems.</p><p>Roberts brings to life the problems migrant workers face today as they attempt to overcome a divisive system that poses a serious challenge to the country’s future development.</p>  </div><div class="field field-name-field-book-review field-type-text-long field-label-above">    <div class="field-label">Book Review: </div>                      <p><a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/books/the-end-game-in-china/article31199890.ece" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Venky Vembu, <em>The Hindu Business Line</em> (March 30, 2020)</a></p><p><a href="https://www.breakingviews.com/features/review-chinas-brewing-blue-collar-rebellion/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pete Sweeney, Reuters (March 27, 2020)</a></p><p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/180005ca-5d74-11ea-8033-fa40a0d65a98" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Geoff Dyer, <em>The Financial Times</em> (March 25, 2020)</a></p><p><a href="https://www.axios.com/china-economic-growth-apartheid-myth-chinese-capitalism-2c66cca7-976d-4cf0-bd72-50c6ad4c015c.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian, Axios (March 4, 2020)</a></p><p><a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-250-08937-3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Publishers Weekly</em> (January 8, 2020)</a></p><p><a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/dexter-roberts/the-myth-of-chinese-capitalism/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Kirkus Reviews</em> (December 8, 2019)</a></p><p><a href="https://qz.com/1813586/dexter-roberts-migrant-worker-inequality-threatens-chinas-future/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mary Hui, Quartz (March 8, 2020)</a></p><p><a href="https://marker.medium.com/inside-the-crisis-facing-the-migrant-chinese-workers-who-power-american-companies-343b632b8130" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Patrick Sauer, Marker (March 12, 2020)</a></p><p><strong>Related Reading:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-discontent-of-migrants-looms-over-china-11583514351" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dexter Roberts, <em>The Wall Street Journal Weekend Review</em> (March 6)</a></p>            </div>  </div>
